## Title README-Generator
## Description: 
A a developer I want to create a README generator. In order to do so I will apply what I learned in class especially in node so that I can  create a professional READMe for a project. 
## Installation:
    Make sure you are using VS Code to make your documents. Then create files such as gitignore and index.js. In your terminal type the following: npm init -y and then npm i inquirer . This should create package-lock.json for you. Then you are ready to run the node index.js later in your terminal. 
## Usage:
    Create your global variables on the top and then .prompt before you start writing down the questions for the user to answer later.  Make sure you include all the requirements of a good README. 
## Credits:
