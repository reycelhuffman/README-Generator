## Title README generator
## Description: 
This project is about making a README using what we learn in class with node. My motivation is that so future user would be able to generate a README easier.
## Installation:
    Make sure you have my GitHub repository cloned or downloaded.  Then in your terminal typed the following: npm init -y enter and then npm i inquirer enter. 
## Usage:
    Make sure you have the requirer and fs in your index.js. Example of usage would be for people who create a repository project and then later on need to have a README.
