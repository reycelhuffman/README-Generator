## Title README Generator
## Description: 
This project is about generating a README for user's to use in their current project. My motivation was that this README generator will make it easier for user to create their own since they will be provided with examples of prompt and codes on how to do it. I learned that by using node making a README can be an easy thing to do.

## Installation:
    User's need to make sure they have a copy or clone of my repository from GitHub and with that they can change their prompt and make it their own. 
## Usage:
    User's need to make sure they type the following into their terminal: npm init -y enter and then npm i inquirer enter . This makes sure your node is ready to run so then later user's would be prompted with the questions that will later print out on the README file.
